# Machine Unlearning with Weighted Data Distillation

The following codebase supplements the paper [*"Machine Unlearning with Weighted Data Distillation"*](ADD LINK HERE).

We conduct experiments to investigate the following research questions:
1. Can data distillation be leveraged for machine unlearning?
2. How does machine unlearning with data distillation compare to standard machine unlearning?

The experiments involve an ablation study on unweighted and weighted data distillation, on two unlearning techniques using the CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets.
